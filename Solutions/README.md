# Solutions

This folder contains solutions to all exercises in the repository.

## Important Guidelines

### Before Looking at Solutions:

1. **Try solving on your own first** - The learning happens during the struggle
2. **Spend at least 15-20 minutes** attempting each exercise
3. **Use the examples** in the topic folder as reference
4. **Break down complex problems** into smaller parts

### How to Use Solutions:

1. **Compare your approach** - Did you solve it differently?
2. **Understand the logic** - Don't just copy, understand why it works
3. **Try variations** - Modify the solution to solve related problems
4. **Note better approaches** - Learn from more efficient solutions

### If Your Solution is Different:

- Different doesn't mean wrong!
- SQL often has multiple valid solutions
- Some solutions may be more efficient than others
- Learn from the differences

## Solution Organization

Solutions are organized by topic, matching the exercise files:

```
Solutions/
├── 01-SELECT-Basics-solutions.sql
├── 02-WHERE-Clause-solutions.sql
├── 03-ORDER-BY-solutions.sql
├── 04-Aggregate-Functions-solutions.sql
├── 05-JOINS-solutions.sql
├── 06-Subqueries-solutions.sql
├── 07-GROUP-BY-solutions.sql
├── 08-Data-Modification-solutions.sql
└── 09-Advanced-Queries-solutions.sql
```

Note: Additional solution files are being added progressively. Start with fundamentals!

## Tips for Learning from Solutions

1. **Type it out** - Don't just read, type the solution yourself
2. **Experiment** - Change parts of the query to see what happens
3. **Explain it** - Can you explain the solution to someone else?
4. **Practice variations** - Modify the problem and solve it again

## Remember

> "The only way to learn programming is by writing code."

The same applies to SQL. Solutions are a learning tool, not a shortcut!
