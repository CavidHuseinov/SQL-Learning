# SQL-Learning 📚

Welcome to my SQL Learning Journey! This repository documents my progress as I restart learning SQL syntax from scratch, focusing on strengthening fundamentals through daily hands-on practice.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master SQL fundamentals through daily practice
- Build strong foundation in database querying
- Develop problem-solving skills with real-world scenarios
- Track progress and maintain consistency

## 📋 Repository Structure

### 01-Fundamentals
Core SQL concepts and syntax:
- **01-SELECT-Basics**: Basic SELECT queries, column selection, DISTINCT
- **02-WHERE-Clause**: Filtering data with conditions, comparison operators
- **03-ORDER-BY**: Sorting results, ASC/DESC
- **04-Aggregate-Functions**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

### 02-Intermediate
Building on the basics:
- **01-JOINS**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN

### 03-Advanced
Advanced SQL operations:
- **01-Data-Modification**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE
- **02-Advanced-Queries**: Window functions, CTEs, complex queries

### Sample-Database
Practice database schema and sample data for exercises

### Solutions
Solutions to all exercises (try solving on your own first!)

### Daily-Practice
Daily challenge tracker and practice log

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with `01-Fundamentals/01-SELECT-Basics`
2. Work through exercises in each folder sequentially
3. Practice daily - consistency is key!
4. Check solutions only after attempting problems
5. Track your progress in `Daily-Practice/tracker.md`

## 📅 Daily Practice Routine

- Spend 30-60 minutes daily on SQL practice
- Complete at least 3-5 exercises per day
- Review previous concepts weekly
- Challenge yourself with increasingly complex queries

## 🎓 Learning Resources

- Each folder contains:
  - `README.md` - Concept explanation and syntax
  - `exercises.sql` - Practice problems
  - `examples.sql` - Sample queries and use cases

## 💪 Progress Tracking

Check `Daily-Practice/tracker.md` to log daily progress and maintain accountability.
